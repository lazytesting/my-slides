# Some metrics

- Lines of code written
- How busy is the team
- Story points
- Succesful sprint %

???
- story points? > relative units
- lines of code written? > let's copy paste some things
- how busy is the team? > high utilisation is actually a bad thing

# 4 metrics
- Lead time
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to restore
- Change fail percentage

---
class: list-slide
# 1. Lead time
- What: 
    - Time between first commit and running in production
- Why: 
    - Enables fast feedback
    - Able to fix defects fast

???
note: we skip the pre-code part here because it's difficult to measure/influence
---
class: list-slide
# 2. Deployment frequency
- What: 
    - Number of release to production
- Why:
    - Enable fast feedback
    - Reduces risk
    - Reduced overhead
???
proxy for batch size

---
class: list-slide
# 3. Mean time to restore
- What: 
    - Time it takes to restore after an outage or major incident
- Why: 
    - Indicator for reliability
    - Quality

???
reliability is not mean time between failures anymore

---
class: list-slide
# 4. Change fail rate
- What: 
    - How many of the changes are failing (%)
- Why: 
    - Indicator for quality

???
when: need a rollback/hotifx/outage

# Can we trick it?
## Yes we can!

???
just push a readme change to production 20 times a day

- complexity
- legacy
- risk
- maturity of the team
- technology
- external dependencies
